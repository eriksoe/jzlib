Changes since version 0.0.1:
............................
- fixed the bad compression ratio problem, which was reported from
  Martin Smith(martin@spamcop.net). The compression ratio was not so good
  compared with the compression ration by zlib. Now, this problem has been
  fixed	and, I hope, deflated files by JZlib and zlib are completely
  same bit by bit. I thank him for his valuable feedback.
