ChangeLog of JZlib
====================================================================
Last modified: Tue Mar 11 13:27:05 UTC 2003


Changes since version 1.0.0:
- added ZInputStream and ZOutputStream classes.
- fixed a typo in LICENSE.txt.

	
Changes since version 0.0.9:
- fixed a bug in setting a dictionary in the inflation process.
- The license was changed to a BSD style license.

	
Changes since version 0.0.8:
- fixed a bug in handling a preset dictionary in the inflation process.

	
Changes since version 0.0.7:
- added methods to control the window size (the size of the history
  buffer) and to handle the no-wrap option (no zlib header or check),
  which is the undocumented functionality of zlib.

	
Changes since version 0.0.6:
- updated InfBlocks.java as zlib did to fix the vulnerability related to
  the 'double free'. Of course, JZlib is free from such a vulnerability
  like the 'double free', but JZlib had crashed with NullPointerException
  by a specially-crafted block of invalid deflated data.	

	
Changes since version 0.0.5:
- added 'flush()' method to com.jcraft.jzlib.ZOutputStream.
- fixed to take care when occurring the buffer overflow in 
  com.jcraft.jzlib.ZOutputStream.
Many thanks to Tim Bendfelt at cs.wisc.edu , who pointed out above problems.
	
	
Changes since version 0.0.4:
............................
- fixed a bug in Adler32 class.
- fixed a bug in ZInputStream class
- modified ZInputStream to be extended from InputStream
  instead of FileInputStream.
- modified ZOutputStream to be extended from OutputStream
  instead of FileOutputStream.
- modified ZStream to be changeable wbits. Give wbits value to
  the method 'deflateInit' of ZStream.	 
Many thanks to Bryan Keller<keller@neomar.com>, who reported bugs
and made suggestions.

	
Changes since version 0.0.3:
............................
- fixed a bug in the compression level 0.
- modified to be compatible with JIKES's bug.
- added Z[Input,Output]Stream written by Lapo Luchini<lapo@lapo.it>.


Changes since version 0.0.2:
............................
- fixed a critical bug, which had arisen in the deflating operation with
  NO_FLUSH and DEFAULT_COMPRESSION mode.
  Many thanks to Bryan Keller(keller@neomar.com), who reported this glitch.


Changes since version 0.0.1:
............................
- fixed the bad compression ratio problem, which is reported from
  Martin Smith(martin@spamcop.net). The compression ratio was not so good
  compared with the compression ration of zlib. Now, this problem has been
  fixed	and, I hope, that deflated files by JZlib and zlib are completely
  same bit by bit.
