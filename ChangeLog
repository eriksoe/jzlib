Changes since version 0.0.2:
............................
- fixed a critical bug, which had arisen in the deflating operation with
  NO_FLUSH and DEFAULT_COMPRESSION mode.
  Many thanks to Bryan Keller(keller@neomar.com), who reported this glitch.

Changes since version 0.0.1:
............................
- fixed the bad compression ratio problem, which is reported from
  Martin Smith(martin@eigroup.com). The compression ratio was not so good
  compared with the compression ration of zlib. Now, this problem has been
  fixed	and, I hope, that deflated files by JZlib and zlib are completely
  same bit by bit.
