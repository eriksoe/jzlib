====================================================================
Last modified: Tue May 29 22:22:33 UTC 2001

Changes since version 0.0.4:
............................
- fixed a bug in Adler32 class.
- fixed a bug in ZInputStream class
- modified ZInputStream to be extended from InputStream
  instead of FileInputStream.
- modified ZOutputStream to be extended from OutputStream
  instead of FileOutputStream.
- modified ZStream to be changeable wbits. Give wbits value to
  the method 'deflateInit' of ZStream.	 
Many thanks to Bryan Keller<keller@neomar.com>, who reported bugs
and made suggestions.

	
Changes since version 0.0.3:
............................
- fixed a bug in the compression level 0.
- modified to be compatible with JIKES's bug.
- added Z[Input,Output]Stream written by Lapo Luchini<lapo@lapo.it>.


Changes since version 0.0.2:
............................
- fixed a critical bug, which had arisen in the deflating operation with
  NO_FLUSH and DEFAULT_COMPRESSION mode.
  Many thanks to Bryan Keller(keller@neomar.com), who reported this glitch.


Changes since version 0.0.1:
............................
- fixed the bad compression ratio problem, which is reported from
  Martin Smith(martin@eigroup.com). The compression ratio was not so good
  compared with the compression ration of zlib. Now, this problem has been
  fixed	and, I hope, that deflated files by JZlib and zlib are completely
  same bit by bit.
